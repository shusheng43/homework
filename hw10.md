1. Bubble Sort the list: 33, 56, 17, 8, 95, 22。Make sure the final result is
from small to large.
Write out the list after the 2nd pass. (10 points)

        答:list={33,56,17,8,95,22}
        for i from 0 to (length - 1) 
        for j from (length - i - 1) to  (length - 1) DO
         if (data[j] > data[j+1]) then
       temp = data[j]
       data[j] = data[j+1]
       data[j+1] = temp
        END IF
        END FOR
        END FOR

2. Give a sorted array as list={60,65,75,80,90,95}. Design an algorithm to
insert the value of x into the sorted array. Then test the algorithm with
value 50,67,99.
思考：为什么选择插入点在list头上、中间、尾巴上的三个数作为算
法测试的数据，你能解释吗？

        答：
        insert a number:
        list = {60,65,75,80,90,95};
        number = x
        for i = 1 to （length-1）
        if （date[i]<x<date[i+1]）{
        for j = i+1 to length{
        temp = date[j]
        date[j] = date [j+1]
        date[j+1] = temp
        }
        }
        else if date







3. What is the state of the stack after the following sequence of Push and
Pop operations?
Push “anne”; Push “get”; Push “your” ; Pop; Push “my” Push “gun” 

        答：
        Push “anne”;  {anne}
        Push “get”;   {anne get}
        Push “your” ; {anne get your}
        Pop;          {anne get}
        Push “my”；   {anne get my}
        Push “gun”    {anne get my gun}
